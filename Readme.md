# A guide for lazy ambitious people.  Built with the collaboration of experience & AI

## [DSA](https://github.com/himansuuverma/learnings/blob/main/dsa/dsa_guide.md)
#### This isn't another DSA cheat sheet. Most guides tell you what to learn — this one tells you how to think. 
> Built from 5+ years of FAANG interview data, cognitive 
science research on how expert programmers actually solve problems, and the 
invisible thinking process of competitive programming grandmasters — reverse-
engineered into a step-by-step system anyone can follow. It covers 14 patterns, 
~120 problems, 14 reusable code templates, and the exact follow-up questions 
interviewers ask — but more importantly, it teaches you to read constraints like
a problem setter, recognize patterns in 60 seconds like a red coder, and 
overcome the cognitive traps that silently block most people from ever getting 
good at DSA. No fluff, no academic theory, no "solve 500 problems and pray." 
Just the shortest path from "I can build real products but DSA bores me" to "no 
interviewer at any top company can reject me."
